# Prediction-of-Heart-Failure-death-using-Neural-Network-
Heart failure occurs when heart fail to supply adequate blood to meet the bodyâ€™s demand. It affects people of all ages, although the elderly is more vulnerable (NHS, 2018). In the United Kingdom, around 7.6 million people suffer from various forms of heart disease and every day 450 people die from heart disease. Main reasons behind heart failure are heart attack,high blood pressure and cardiomyopathy.

# Project Overview 
Exploratory Data analysis is perfomred on the dataset to derive insights from the dataset .Factor analysis is done in the dataset to reduce the dimensionality of the datsaset.To predict if the person will survive or not Artificial neural network model is built using neuralnet library in R.
